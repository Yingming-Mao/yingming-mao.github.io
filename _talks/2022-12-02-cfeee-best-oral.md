I am honored to have received the **Best Oral Presentation Award** at the 5th International Conference on Frontiers of Energy and Environment Engineering (CFEEE 2022).

This presentation discussed the methodologies for evaluating and enhancing the accuracy of linear power flow models, especially when dealing with large system fluctuations. This work was conducted as part of my research in power system stability and later published in *IJEPES*.
