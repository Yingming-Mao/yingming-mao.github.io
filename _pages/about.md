I am a Ph.D. student at **Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU)** and **Shanghai Institute of Intelligent Science and Technology (SII)**, majoring in Control Science and Engineering with a focus on **AI Infrastructure**. My research lies at the intersection of large-scale network optimization and intelligent power systems.

## Research Interests
* 🔍 **Data Center Networks (DCN):** Traffic Engineering (TE) and Topology Engineering in large-scale and reconfigurable networks.
* 📊 **Microgrid Management:** Optimal scheduling and planning for microgrids with high-penetration renewable energy.
* 💡 **Power System Analysis:** Linear power flow modeling and data generation considering spatial correlations.

## Education
* **Ph.D. in Control Science and Engineering**, Xi'an Jiaotong University & Shanghai Institute of Intelligent Science and Technology, 2022 – Present
* **B.E. in Automation**, Xi'an Jiaotong University, 2018 – 2022
